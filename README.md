## Selenium with C# Fundamentals


### About this repository
I present my progress in learning of Selenium using C# for automation test.
#### What is Selenium?
Selenium is the most popular tool to test websites! Join me and hundreds of students to learn Selenium Webdriver!


#### Description
Selenium Webdriver is a free automation testing tool for web applications. It is able to work with different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera and simulate human like behavior. Selenium is able to interact with all the different elements in a webpage. It can click on them, input text, extract text and much more. By covering all the different functionalities on the website with Selenium tests, I want to show how quickly catch new and reappearing old bugs. This will save your team time and money.


#### In this Repository:
I would like to focus on Graphic User Interface and Functionality Testing and I will learn how to work with the various element selectors and special elements like:

ID, Name, CSS, Xpath and Class Selectors

Textbox, Check box, Radio buttons, Drop down Menus

JavaScript Alert Boxes

Then I would like to start creating our Automation Framework with Selenium! When I learn how to create a Framework, I hope that I will be able to write correct Selenium WebDriver tests!

This Repository should also includes:
