## Selenium with C# Fundamentals


### About this repository
I present my progress in learning of Selenium using C# for automation test.
#### What is Selenium?
Selenium is the most popular tool to test websites! Join me and hundreds of students to learn Selenium Webdriver!


#### Description
Selenium Webdriver is a free automation testing tool for web applications. It is able to work with different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera and simulate human like behavior. Selenium is able to interact with all the different elements in a webpage. It can click on them, input text, extract text and much more. By covering all the different functionalities on your website with Selenium tests, you will be able to quickly catch new and reappearing old bugs. This will save your team time and money.


#### In this Repository:
I would like to focus on Graphic User Interface and Functionality Testing and we will learn how to work with the various element selectors and special elements like:

ID, Name, CSS, Xpath and Class Selectors

Textbox, Check box, Radio buttons, Drop down Menus

JavaScript Alert Boxes

We will also have a few theory lectures about Selenium and testing in general in which I will explain:

When you should use either of these selectors;

What is a Test Case/Scenario

How you can use Mindmaps in testing

Then we will start creating our Automation Framework with Selenium! When you learn how to create a Framework by the end of the course, you will be able to write your Selenium WebDriver tests in Plain English!

This course also includes lectures on:

Running Tests on Mobile Devices with Selenium and Appium

Parallel Testing with Selenium and NUnit3 (running multiple tests at the same time)

Generating beautiful HTML Reports for our Test Results with Selenium and NUnit3

Using Different Browsers - Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, Firefox

Taking Screenshots with Selenium

Using PhantomJS Driver and Selenium (we have a project here to download all posts from a website!)

Working with Element Properties (Size, Location, Stylings, e.g. change colors or make elements disappear)

Executing Javascript through C# with Selenium

Working with Browser Properties (Size, Location, New Tabs/Windows, Tabs/Windows Handles)
